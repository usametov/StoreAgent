# StoreAgent
This is a little demo of Agent app operating Vending Machine.

Before running this app, we should set evironment variables for AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT.

This little agent app interprets customer requests and answers questions for a general store similar to Walmart.
A customer may ask a question that the LLM interprets and routes to a specific department to show availability and prices for asked by the customer using the LLM.

App design is available here: docs/code-walkthrough.md
